# TestRepository
Test repository for Programming Studio

So this is the readme section?
（According to instructor）Add the following line of text to the Readme by editing it directly on GitHub and committing the change:"This is my first commit." (by the way, also the first project I created, so of course there will be mistakes and etc.)

# How to Run This Program:

basically just open it in any web browser


# Since this is currently unfinished:
It only do calculations in the format of (number1) (operation) (number2) = result, therefore it can only calculate two numbers at a time.

Its decimal point havn't been adjusted yet so the decimal point can be entered several times.

It do not store the result of the last operation yet so it cannot perfom successive operation at this time. User will have to enter the number again.

Some of its operations are still being tested.

# Will the problems be solved?
Yes, if I can solve them.
